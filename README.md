# miniFOCctrl
it is a super-mini  FOC Driver used by STM/GD32F405RGT6

#
modification:1. in my case, i'm using 3510 motor: 11 pair magnet, Rs = 7.5 ohm Ls = 1.53 mH
             2. and using fast sin cos algorithm(from my other forked prj: foc_learning). it better then st offical dsp. 
# 

# this hardware and software come from https://github.com/hvan110/miniFOCctrl.git

test fast sin cos algorithm
